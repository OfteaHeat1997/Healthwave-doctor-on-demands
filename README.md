## Name

Duo Case 12 Doctor on demand Healthwave

## Description

This project aims to develop a mobile application that provides a platform for people in developing countries to conveniently communicate with doctors. Additionally, users can leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to ask basic medical questions and seek guidance for their healthcare needs.
In many parts of the world, it can be challenging for individuals in underserved communities to have easy access to healthcare professionals. This mobile app bridges the gap by providing a user-friendly interface that connects users to a network of doctors who are willing to offer their expertise remotely.
By utilizing the app, individuals can schedule virtual appointments with doctors, avoiding the need for physical visits to healthcare facilities. This proves particularly beneficial in areas where medical resources are limited or inaccessible. The app also presents an opportunity for remote diagnosis, empowering users to receive medical advice without traveling long distances.
Moreover, the integration of AI technology within the app allows users to ask basic medical questions and receive informative responses. Designed to understand natural language and provide accurate information, the AI feature assists users in understanding symptoms, identifying potential ailments, and suggesting appropriate next steps. This functionality proves invaluable in providing immediate guidance and potentially reducing the need for unnecessary medical consultations.
In conclusion, this mobile app project proposes an innovative solution to enhance healthcare accessibility in developing countries. By combining the convenience of virtual communication with doctors and the intelligence of AI technology, it aims to empower individuals to seek medical advice and care more efficiently, ultimately improving the overall healthcare experience in these communities.


## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
